# MultiStringMultiFileSearcher
Simple console application to take an input file with a list of search strings, and search all files under a directory for any of those search strings.  Output saved to csv.

RegexParser project is based on the source code by Farhad Alizadeh Noori shared at https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/677580/Combined-Regular-Expression-Search, with some modifications to suit my needs.
